# Interface (GUI)
The "interface.py" file is the code that contains entirely the GUI code . Also the lookup table named "data.txt" is present within this directory to ensure that the code runs.
There is an option to plot and record readings in realtime while using the GUI which will be stored in the "log.txt" file. This log file can be used with matlab later on to compare graphs.
The file named "final_arduino.ino" contains the arduino code for the servo motors and the arduino UNO board used from the feedback recieved from the camera
